# IoT-Thermostat-WebApp
WebApp that allows to control and view the data uploaded from the thermostat (see [this repository](https://github.com/nicolalombardi/IoT-Thermostat-ESP8266) for the details).

The web app is written using the [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) framework and it also behaves as a PWA (Progressive Web App).
